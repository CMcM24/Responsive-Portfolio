                    <p>Hi everyone! Welcome to my Portfolio. I'm currently enrolled in the Rutgers Coding Bootcamp in order to gain the skills necessary to make a career move into development. Its been eye opening so far, but this isn't actually my first time dabbling in code. When I was a senior in highschool (2009-2010) I took Web Page Design as an elective. It wasn't because I was particularly interested at the time; I just needed to fill the class slot and I had a friend who had signed up for it. Not much thought went into it, but it was a course dedicated to the basics of html and css. I learned a good deal over that semester, but honestly, I learned more in the first few weeks of this course than I did in the three months in that higschool elective.</p>

                    <p>A little about me: I'm currently an IT Sales Rep. with a B.A. in Criminal Justice and a work history in Pool Deck management and Office Security. Admittedly not the most consistent resume in the world, but I wouldn't redo any of it. I graduated from a military cadet program at Norwich University in 2014 with the intent to become a military aviator. That plan was stopped short when I was medically disqualified for astigmatism. Got the security job, moved to IT Sales after a couple of years, and here I am learning to code.</p>
